      Colosseum
    </h1><i>Cute Monsters? No. Royalty!</i>

    <p>
      Colosseum started off as an experiment in game design and a cure for card game boredom at 2AM on a camping trip.
      Colosseum is to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon_Trading_Card_Game">Pokémon TCG</a> as <a href=
      "http://airship.home.mchsi.com/duel.htm">Duel</a> is to <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_the_gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a>. It is an adaptation of the well-known
      Pokémon Card Game for a pack of regular playing cards. It's not intended to replace the original, but it's a fun game
      to play in its own right. Even if you hate everything about dueling creatures packed in air-tight balls for a G-rated
      version of cock-fighting, this game should provide a bit more strategy than most run-of-the-mill card games out there
      and still provide a good amount of luck associated.

      Creature Types
    </h2>

    <p>
      Each of the four suits possesses a creature type that determines the weakness and resistance of each creature. Each
      suit also possesses a different status effect which may be used after each creature has evolved, we'll return to
      status effects a little later, after we introduce the creatures in the game. Below is a handy chart for which type
      each suit possesses, and what each type is weak and resistant to.

      <i>The way one would use this chart is to look at the desired suit and see which suits affect it in the way of
      weakness and resistance.<br>
      For example, The Hearts suit may also be referred to as "Psychic", it is weak to Spades (Ghost) and is resistant to
      Clubs (Fighting).</i>

      Weakness/Resistance
    </h2>A creature who is weak to the opponent's creature type takes 10 more damage after an attack is dealt. A creature
    who is resistant to an opponent's creature type takes 10 less damage after an attack is dealt.
    <blockquote>
      <i><u>Example</u><br>

      A King of Hearts is in play and the opponent's active creature is a Jack of Spades.<br>
      When the Jack of Spades attacks the King of Hearts, it does 20 damage instead of 10.<br>
      If the King of Hearts wishes to attack for 30, the Jack of Spades only takes 20 damage since he is resistant to
      Hearts.</i>

    <p>
      The retreat cost is always one less than the attack cost for each creature. This stays true even after Evolution.
    </p>
    <h2>

      Evolution
    </h2>
    <p>
      After you have kept a Basic Creature in play for one turn, you have the option of evolving the creatures to gain
      strength, health, and status effects special to each type. Evolution may be done by placing the next card in one's
      suit hierarchy on top of a currently existing creature in the playing area. For each evolution, 20 health is added and
      10 more damage is given to the attack. The creature also gains a status effect for that type. The attack cost equals
      that of the previous evolution.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i><u>Example</u><br>
      A King of Diamonds that evolved from a Queen possesses 60HP and may use the King's attack of 30 with only 2 energy
      cards.<br>
      It also gains the ability to paralyze creatures.</i>

    </blockquote>The Joker, may be used as an evolution card as well. If a Joker is used on top of any creature, their HP
    and attack rise +20/+20. The creature is also made colorless, meaning it may use any suit of cards for energy and
    possesses no weakness, resistance, or status effects. Once a Joker is used, that creature may no longer evolve in the
    game.<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <u>Evolution Chain</u><br>
      Basic Creature -&gt; Level 1 -&gt; Level 2 or higher -&gt; Joker
    </blockquote>

    <h2>
      Status Effects
    </h2>
    <p>
      Each type possesses a specific status effect that may be used after evolution. When a card is evolved once (a level 1
      evolution) the player must flip a coin after attacking in order to inflict the status effect on the opponent. If
      heads, the status effect occurs, if tails, it fails. If a card has been evolved at lease twice (level 2 or higher
      creature) there is no need to flip a coin and the status effect is inflicted upon the opponent.
    </p>The following is a list of each status effect available to the specific creature types:
    <blockquote>
      <b>Confusion - Hearts (Psychic)</b><br>
      If confusion is inflicted upon an opponent, the opponent must flip a coin before they attempt to attack or retreat. If
      heads, the player attacks and retreats normally. If tails however, any attempts at retreating fail and the creature
      attacks itself if the coin flip was intended for an attack.<br>

      <br>
      <b>Poison - Spades (Ghosts)</b><br>
      At the end of the opponent's turn, 10 damage will be inflicted upon the poisoned creature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Paralysis - Diamonds (Electric)</b><br>
      The opponent may not attack or retreat their creature for one turn.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Pummel - Clubs (Fighting)</b><br>
      10 damage is inflicted on any selected creature on the bench, no weakness or resistance is applied.
    </blockquote>Poison and Confusion may be removed only when the inflicted creature returns to the bench.
    <h2>
      Energy Cards
    </h2>
    <p>
      Energy cards are used to pay for your creature's attack cost and retreat cost. The number cards (2-10) function as
      energy cards in this game. You just attach a number card of the creature's suit to the creature and use that energy
      for as long as it is attached. Energy cards must be discarded for retreat cost. All number cards provide 1 energy.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

      <i><u>Example</u></i><br>
      You attach a 4 of Hearts to a Queen of Hearts to provide 1 Energy for use in attacking or retreating.
    </blockquote>
    <h2>
      Trainer Cards
    </h2>
    <p>
      Trainer cards provide many uses and are vital to good strategy. Many are used for disruption of your opponent's game,
      or for leveraging your own. Number cards may be used as either Energy cards and Trainer cards, it's your choice. You
      may use cards of any suit.
    </p>The following is a list of Trainer Cards and their uses in this game:
    <blockquote>

      <b>2 - Bill</b><br>
      Draw 2 Cards.<br>
      <b>3 - Evil Bill</b><br>
      Look at your opponent's hand, choose 1 card of theirs to discard.<br>
      <b>4 - Potion</b><br>
      Remove 20 damage from your creature.<br>

      <b>5 - Transfer (Switch/Gust of Wind)</b><br>
      You may either switch your own active creature with another on the bench, or switch your opponent's active creature
      for one on his or her own bench.<br>
      <b>6 - Energy Removal</b><br>
      Remove 1 energy card from one of your opponent's creatures.<br>
      <b>7 - Professor Oak</b><br>
      Discard hand, draw 5 cards.<br>

      <b>8 - Defender</b><br>
      Attach to your active creature to reduce your opponent's next attack by 20 damage. Discard after one turn.<br>
      <b>9 - PlusPower</b><br>
      Adds 10 damage to an attack, discard after attacking.<br>
      <b>10 - Heal</b><br>
      Remove status effect on creature.

    <h2>
      Game Setup
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each player draws 4-6 cards from the deck to function as "Prizes", place them face down on the side of their
      playing area.
        <ul>
          <li>Amount of Prize cards depends on how long each player wishes to play the game, provide handicap, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each player draws 5 cards. This will function as the player's hand.
        <ul>
          <li>If a player possesses no basic creatures in their first hand, they must show their opponent, shuffle their
          hand back into the deck and draw another 5 cards.
          </li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each player places the creatures they want to play face down on the playing area.
        <ul>
          <li>One must be the active creature, and a maximum of 3 creatures may be benched, creating a maximum of 4
          creatures in play.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Flip a coin to determine who goes first.
      </li>

      <li>The first person to play does not draw a card in their first turn.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Playing a Turn
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Draw
      </li>
      <li>Attach Energy Card (once)
      </li>

      <li>Play a Trainer Card

      <li>Cleanup Phase (discard cards in hand down to 5)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Deck
    </h2>
    <p>
      As you play, you'll notice the deck getting thinner. Depending on how many Oaks and Bills you and your opponent play,
      this may be faster than anyone expects. Not a problem. As soon as you run out of cards in your deck, just take the
      discard pile, shuffle it and it will function as your main library again. This is the reason why cleanup phase is so
      important in this card game, the deck may still keep on giving until the point somebody wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope you enjoy the rules!
